This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
#code visibility
echo = TRUE  

#unzipping and reading of data

unzip("activity.zip")
x <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("integer", "Date", "factor"))
x$month <- as.numeric(format(x$date, "%m"))
noNA <- na.omit(x)
rownames(noNA) <- 1:nrow(noNA)
head(noNA)
dim(noNA)
library(ggplot2)

```

What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Histogram representation
```{r}
ggplot(noNA, aes(date, steps)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", colour = "black", fill = "black", width = 0.7) + facet_grid(. ~ month, scales = "free") + labs(title = "Total no of steps taken everyday", x = "Date", y = "Total number of steps")
```

Mean and Median
```{r}
totalSteps <- aggregate(noNA$steps, list(Date = noNA$date), FUN = "sum")$x
mean(totalSteps)
median(totalSteps)
```

What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
#average calculation
avgstp <- aggregate(noNA$steps, list(interval = as.numeric(as.character(noNA$interval))), FUN = "mean")
names(avgstp)[2] <- "meanstps"
#plot of 5 min time intervals
ggplot(avgstp, aes(interval, meanstps)) + geom_line(color = "black", size = 0.8) + labs(title = "Plot of the time Interval", x = "5 min intervals", y = "Avg no of steps taken")

#average no of mean steps
avgstp[avgstp$meanstps == max(avgstp$eanstps), ]
```

Inputing missing Values

```{r}
#total number of NA rows
sum(is.na(x))

#filling in of data set with missging data filled in
newdataY <- x
for (i in 1:nrow(newdataY)) {
  if (is.na(newdataY$steps[i])) {
    newdataY$steps[i] <- avgstp[which(newdataY$interval[i] == avgstp$interval), ]$meanstps}
  }
head(newdataY) # displays values while next statement verifies that there are no missing values
sum(is.na(newdataY))

#plotting of a histogram for mean and median steps each day
ggplot(newdataY, aes(date, steps)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity",colour = "black",fill = "black",width = 0.7) + facet_grid(. ~ month, scales = "free") + labs(title = "Total no of steps everday (excluding missing data)", x = "Date", y = "Total no of steps")

#mean total steps
newTotalStps <- aggregate(newdataY$steps, list(Date = newdataY$date), FUN = "sum")$x
MeanY <- mean(newTotalStps)
MeanY
#median total steps
MedianY <- median(newTotalStps)
MedianY

#comparision of both values before and after missing data
MeanX <- mean(totalSteps)
MedianX <- median(totalSteps)
MeanY - MeanX
MedianY - MedianX
```

Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r}
#creating new factor levels to distinguish between weekday and weekend
head(newdataY)
newdataY$weekdays <- factor(format(newdataY$date, "%A"))
levels(newdataY$weekdays) <- list(weekday = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"), weekend = c("Saturday", "Sunday"))
levels(newdataY$weekdays) 
table(newdataY$weekdays)

#average  no of steps taken across weekdays and weekends
avgstp <- aggregate(newdataY$steps, list(interval = as.numeric(as.character(newdataY$interval)), weekdays = newdataY$weekdays), FUN = "mean")
names(avgstp)[3] <- "meanstps"
library(lattice)
 xyplot(avgstp$meanstps ~ avgstp$interval | avgstp$weekdays, layout = c(1, 2), type = "l", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "No. of steps")
```
